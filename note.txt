1: zhang
2: nosig14_nol2: fc, no sig, full batch, uniform l1, mean first [zhang better woard end]
3: zhang_mean_fc_nosig18: attn to lw, lr 01, fixed init [nosig14_nol2 better toward start]
4.1: ig: ig -  clear winner
4.2: mlw_r_single: zhang_mean_fc_nosig18 clear winner. but mlw_r_single has promise for multiple.

(4.2)1 - mlw_r (multi): mlw_r  clear winner than mlw_r_single and 18

compare mlw_r and ig: mlw_r slightly better

compare mlwrig_nol2 = ig + mlw_r
